                <div class="textconclusion"><p>Based on our research we found a lot of exciting information about our target audience, young adults aged 18-25 and high school students. We found out that the average allowance, per week, given to our target audience is 879 pesos. The majority of their allowance goes to savings, next is food, and the 3rd most common expense is online shopping. We also found it interesting that one of the more unimportant expenses people consider is the videogame money and coffee money.
                    Though we consider our research a success, we still have a few issues. One of our main issues is the vagueness of our target audience. Due to the fact our target being so wide, the information we present may not be the most accurate and exact. 
                    If we were to improve anything for future researches, we recommend limiting our target audience. I also recommend being more specific with the questions, to avoid any outliers. Lastly, aside from narrowing our range in target audience, we would also like to get more respondents. Getting more respondents means we can get more variety in answers, but still minimize the amount of outliers.
                    Through this activity, we learned the importance of data, and how statistics is the basis of all sciences. Through data analysis, we learn more about how our society works, preferences of the masses. We can make a conclusion on how to further improve our society and how we can move forward with it.
